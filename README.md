# Game for Stijn (WIP)

## how to play:
### Brick Breaker:
a and d to move Stijn, stop the bot from entering your stream (represented by the bottom of the screen). Try to hit the viewers with the bot and then catch them to gain points! If the bot enters your stream, never fear, your mods are here! But watch out, as your mods will have to sacrifice themselves to stop the bot, so your "lives" are limited! Watch out for falling Wardens, as they will kill Stijn!

### Marbles:
hold left click + move mouse to move the camera; right click to follow a marble and left click to stop following; mouse wheel to zoom in/out

If an update to the game doesn't seem to change anything to the web version, try erasing your browser cache because it can cause you to be stuck in an older version of the game.
